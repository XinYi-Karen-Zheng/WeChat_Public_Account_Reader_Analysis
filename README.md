# WeChat Public Account Reader Analysis
Can be used to analyze reader data provided by the WeChat public account platform, and further explore characteristics of this population.

### Background<br />
Many people choose to open a WeChat public account (similar to a blog) to share useful information. However, without a deep understanding of the target reader population as well as its characteristics, accounts are hard to grow at a fast pace. Thus, as a WeChat public account owner, I started this project to learn more about my readers.

### Using Own Reader Data<br />
The Wechat public account platform tracks and provides reader data, and that's the most direct data reflecting reader characteristics.
The data come in two forms, a general one and a 7-day detailed one.

The general form provides infomation on number of followers the account have when the account sent the post, and the total number of people who read the post to date.

The more detailed form tracks data within seven days from the day the post is sent.For each day, it records
* number of people who read the post
* number of current followers who read the post
* number of people who opened the post from WeChat moments
* number of people who forwarded/recommended this post to other people
* number of people who favorited the post

For my account, I divided my articles into five different categories:
* school (ex. how to start/manage a STEM club in high school)
* competition (ex. AMC, HiMCM)
* summer experience (ex. inviting people to write about their experiences attending summer camps)
* summer introduction (ex. provide factual information about summer camps)
* testing (ex. SAT, ACT study tips)

The program in own_reader_data analyzes which category attracts my readers the most. Results and explanation is on my data project (link: https://karenzxy.wixsite.com/dpdp2)
