# WeChat Public Account Reader Analysis
Can be used to analyze reader data provided by the WeChat public account platform, and further explore characteristics of this population.

### Background<br />
Many people choose to open a WeChat public account (similar to a blog) to share useful information. However, without a deep understanding of the target reader population as well as its characteristics, accounts are hard to grow at a fast pace. Thus, as a WeChat public account owner, I started this project to learn more about my readers.
